# DigitalFootprintsintheSand
Welcome to our Github page!

Digital Footprints in the Sand is a fun interactive question and answer game based around open source intelligence (OSINT) that will require you to put your investigative skills to the test to find the answers that are all hidden in public view. The game varies in terms of the types of questions and recommended tools, with some questions requiring you to select from multiple choice options, or having to type in an answer. While the questions will provide feedback on whether your answers are right or wrong, we do not tell you the correct answer in the case of the wrong choice, as we hope you will not only play again, but will try to figure out where you might have gone wrong. While all the questions we've included are technically solvable without the use of any third party apps or tools, as we've tried to provide guidance to online solutions, we do have a few questions towards the end of the questionaire where we do recommend the use of certain programs, which we've included short how-tos for. Again, you do not have to use them, however we recommend them both for ease, and for learning more about some of the most powerful and common OSINT tools availabe.

We hope you enjoy the game, and learning about all the various kinds of tools and data that are available for using in your future endevours.
